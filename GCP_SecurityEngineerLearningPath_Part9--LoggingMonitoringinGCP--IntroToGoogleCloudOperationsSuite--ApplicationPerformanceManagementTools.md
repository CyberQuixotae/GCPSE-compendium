# Application Performance Management Tools

## Cloud Trace
- Collects latency data from your distributed applications and displays it in the Google Cloud console.
- Captures traces from applications deployed on App Engine, Compute Engine VMs, and Google Kubernetes Engine containers.

## Latency reports
- Provide performance insights in near-real time.
- Generate in-depth latency reports to surface performance degradations.
- Indentify recent changes to application performance.

## Cloud Profiler
- Uses statistical techniques and extremely low-impact instrumentation to provide a complete picture of an application
- Allows developers to analyze applications running anywhere.
- Presents the call hierarchy and resource consumption of the relevant function in an interactive flame graph.
