### Access Context Manager reduces the size of your privileged network

- Access Context Manager is a tool with an API that allows Google Cloud organization administrators to define fine-grained, attribute based access control for projects and resources in Google Cloud.

- Administrators first define an access policy, which is an organization-wide container for organizing access levels and service perimeters, that includes the necessary requirements for requests to be allowed.

- Requirements may include:
    - Device type and OS
    - IP address
    - User identity

### What is an access policy?
- An access policy acts as a container for access levels, and as such, a single access policy can contain multiple access levels.

# What are Access Levels?
- An access level is a set of attributes (such as IP address, device type and User identity) that are assigned to requests based on their origin.
- Access levels are customizable; "High_Trust," "Medium_Trust," and “Low_Trust” are examples.
