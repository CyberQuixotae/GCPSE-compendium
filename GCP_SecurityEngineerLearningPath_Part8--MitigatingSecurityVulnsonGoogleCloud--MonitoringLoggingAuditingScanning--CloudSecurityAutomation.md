# Cloud Security automation

## Security automation benefits
- Improves consistency, quickness, and reliability.
- Once you have encapsulated some task in automation, anyone can execute the task.
- Allows scaling faster than the growth of threats and assets.

## Security automation risks
- Automated responses can sometimes result in disastrous outcomes, if not planned correctly.
    - Example: production systems at a major technology companies deleted.

- Ensure you have:
    - Peer reviews
    - QA & testing
    - Highly descriptive playbooks
    - Other processes in place when developing automated responses.

## Security automation service examples
- Security Command Center: automates the discovery of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and detects threats targeting your Google Cloud assets
- Web Security Scanner: automates the testing of security vulnerabilities in your web applications by following links and exercising as many user inputs and event handlers as possible
- Artifact Registry: automatically detects risky images from being deployed to Google Kubernetes Engine.
