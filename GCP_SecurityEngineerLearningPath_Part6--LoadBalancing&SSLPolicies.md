### Google Cloud load balancers support SSL for encryption in transit.
- Google Cloud load balancers support HTTPS or SSL Proxy for encryption in transit.
    - In this course, the term “SSL” refers to both the SSL and TLS protocols.
    -  Load balancers require at least one signed SSL certificate installed on the target HTTPS proxy for the load balancer.

### Google Cloud offers three pre-configured managed SSL profiles
- Compatible: Allows the broadest set of clients
- Modern: Supports a wide set of SSL/TLS features, allowing modern clients to negotiate SSL/TLS.
- Restricted: Supports a reduced set of SSL/TLS features, intended to meet stricter compliance requirements

### Custom SSL policy profiles
- Allow SSL features to be individually specified; you can specify the exact SSL features requires.
