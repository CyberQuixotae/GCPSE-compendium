#  Monitoring and Dashboarding Multiple Projects

## Objectives
- Configure a Worker project.
- Create a metrics scope and link the two worker projects into it.
- Create and configure Monitoring Groups.
- Create and test an uptime check.

## Task 1. Configure the resource projects
- Open a text document on your computer and in it, make note of the three project IDs:
    - Label Project ID 1 as **Monitoring Project**.
    - Label Project ID 2 as **Worker 1**.
    - Label Project ID 3 as **Worker 2**.

    In the rest of this exercise, the project IDs are referred to by these names.

- In the Google Cloud Console page, use the project dropdown near the upper-left corner of the interface to switch to the `Worker 1` project. Remember, it is the project with the ID you labeled **Worker 1** in the text file you created in Step 1.
