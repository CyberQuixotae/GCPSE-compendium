# Cloud Audit Logs
- Records Google Cloud account activity, including actions performed with the Google Cloud Console, command line tools, APIs, and AWS services.
    - Who?
    - Did What?
    - Where and When?

## Cloud Audit Logs maintain four audit logs for each project, folder, and organization:
- **Admin Activity**
- **System Events**
- **Data Access**
- **Policy Denied**

## Admin Activity audit logs
- Contain log entries for API calls or other administrative actions that modify the configuration or metadata of resources.
- Always enabled.

## System Event audit logs
- Record when Compute Engine performs a system event.
    - For example, each live migration is recorded as a system event.
    - Always enabled
    - There is no charge for your System Event audit logs.

## Data Access audit logs
- API calls that create, modify, or read user-provided data.
- Disabled by default.
- Note that Data Access audit logs do not record data-access operations on resources that are publicly shared.

## Policy Denied audit logs
-  Recorded when a Google Cloud service denies access to a user or service account because of a security policy violation.
- Generated by default.
- Your Cloud project is charged for the logs storage.
- You can't disable Policy Denied audit logs, but you can use exclusion filters to prevent Policy Denied audit logs from being ingested and stored in Cloud Logging.

## BigQuery Data Access audit logs
- Handled different from other Data Access logs.
- Always enabled.

## Viewing audit logs
You can view audit log entries in:
- Project's Activity page
