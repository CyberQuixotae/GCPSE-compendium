# GCPSE-compendium
Notes related to publicly available study material for the Google Cloud Professional Security Engineer Certification (or GCPSEC). I will try my best to keep this as organized and as consistent as possible, but I can't make any hard promises. I am doing this primarily for myself because I find the note-taking helpful for understanding the concepts and mapping them inside my electric meatball. Please let me know if you find this helpful as a way to summarize and review certain sections. Most of this info isn't new or relevatory, and I provide links for each module on the cloudskillbost.google domain for the Security Engineer path I'm following. 

Feedback is always appreciated. Let me know if this helps you, or what else you would like to see that might make it more useful!
