# Authentication & Authorization

## GKE Supports two types of authentication
- User accounts
- Service accounts

## Kubernetes and Google service accounts differ
### Kubernetes service accounts are:
- A part of the cluster.
- Generally used within that cluster.

### Google service accounts:
- Are part of the Google Cloud project.
- Can be granted permissions to clusters and other Cloud resources.
- Use IAM to manage permissions.

### Role-based access control (RBAC) gives your resources finer access granularity
