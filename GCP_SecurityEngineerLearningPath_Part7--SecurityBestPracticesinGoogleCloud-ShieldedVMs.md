[What is Shielded VM?](https://cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/shielded-vm)

# Using Shielded VMs helps protect workloads from remote attacks, privilege escalation, and malicious insiders
- Protect against advanced threats with just a few clicks
- Ensure that workloads are trusted and verificable
- Protects secrets against replay and exfiltration

- Secure boot prevents loading of malicious code during bootup.
   - Shielded VM instances accomplish this with UEFI firmware.

- Measured boot checks for modified components during bootup.
- Measured boot uses a virtualized Trusted Platform Module (vTPM)

# Shielded VM is available in all of the same regions as Compute Engine, with no added charges for use
