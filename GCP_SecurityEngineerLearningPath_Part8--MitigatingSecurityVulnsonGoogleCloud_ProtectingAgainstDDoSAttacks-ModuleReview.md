# Module Review
- DDoS attacks overwhelm a server with a flood of traffic to disrupt services.
- DDoS attacks often use servers and computers infected with malware.
- DDoS mitigation requires a multi-layered approach designed to absorb attacks, reduce risk, isolate sensitive traffic, and monitor systems for signs of malicious behavior.

- Google Cloud provides tools for all of these uses:
    - Google Cloud load balancing.
    - VPCs that control traffic via firewall rules and isolate sensitive servers.
    - Cloud Endpoint or Apigee as API management gateways.
    - Cloud CDN for content service outside Google Cloud.
    - Google Cloud Armor for application and system defense at scale.
- Third party options are also available that completement Google Cloud products.
