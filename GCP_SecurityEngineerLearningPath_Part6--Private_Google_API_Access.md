### Private Google API access
- Allows Compute Engine instances without an external IP address to reach Google APIs and services.
- API call is still resolved to a public IP address, but the traffic is all internal and private.
- The Cloud and Developer APIs and services that can be reached include, but are not limited to: BigQuery, Cloud Bigtable Container Registry, Dataproc Datastore Pub/Sub Cloud Spanner, and Cloud Storage
- Private Google Access does not apply to instances with external IP addresses.
- Private Google Access has no effect on whether or not these instances can access Google APIs and services because both have external IP addresses.
