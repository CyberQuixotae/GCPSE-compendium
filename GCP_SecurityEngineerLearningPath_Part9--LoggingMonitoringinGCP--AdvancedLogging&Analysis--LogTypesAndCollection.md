# Log types and collection

## Available Logs
- **Platform logs**: Platform logs are logs written by Google Cloud services.These logs can help you debug and troubleshoot issues, and help you better understand the Google Cloud services you're using.
- **Component logs**: Similar to platform logs, but they are generated by Google-provided software components that run on your systems.
- **Security logs**: Security logs help you answer "who did what, where, and when." Cloud Audit Logs provide information about administrative activities and accesses within your Google Cloud resources. Access Transparency provides you with logs of actions taken by Google staff when accessing your Google Cloud content.
- **User-written logs**: Written by custom applications and services. Typically, these logs are written to Cloud Logging by using Ops Agent or Cloud Logging API or Cloud Logging client libraries
- Multi/Hybrid Cloud logs

## Some logs from Google Cloud resources are collected automatically
**Google Kubernetes Engine**: Logs written to **stdout** and **stderr** are collected automatically
**Google Compute Engine**: Install the **Ops Agent** on your VMs
**Serverless compute services**: Logs written to **stdout** and **stderr** are collected automatically
